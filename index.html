            goes, there is no place like home. Wehn you lost your place

          <h3>What Just happened ?</h3>
          <p>
            Nobody knows. As far as I can tell, something happened last night.
            Something big. Our whole world was turned upside down. Town destroyed.
            Some weird, huge monsters comes out nowhere. Some people survived,
            some people died, and others just disappears. No one knows why.
            Maybe you can help us find the answer
          </p>

          <h3>Monsters ?</h3>
          <p>
            Most of our towns were destroyed by monster. They appears out of
            thin air, and just started a mayhem. Many brave warriors have died
            fighting them. We don't know anything about them other than they're
            huge, bleeds orange fluid and comes in different shape and weapons.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lucky for us, as a species who likes to kill each other, we have
            developed some weapons that can fight them. We call our weapon "Gears",
            a huge, mechanical robots we build to slay monsters. Maybe those
            monsters are Devil that we pissed by building these thing.
          </p>

        <article>
          <h3>Where can i get one of these "Gears" ?</h3>
          <p>
            I don't know, kid. Every place imaginable to get them have been destroyed.
            Maybe you can buy it from other survivor. As they said, money can buy
            ANYTHING. Maybe you can loot it from some of our fallen warrior. Or
            maybe you can just build one yourself.
